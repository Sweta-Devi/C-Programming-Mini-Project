            Procedual Programming pparadigm lays more emphasis on procedure or the algorithm.
            Data is considered secondary. Data is loosely available to many function.

        <p>Major limitations of procedural programming paradigm are:</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>It is susceptible to increased time and cost overheads during design change.</li>
